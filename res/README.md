Configuration file and Tools
============================


This folder hold three subfolders:
 * sb-res: This folder is holding shadow-builder configurations xml files
 * tfa-res: This folder is holding TFA confguration files,
 * tools: holding tools to help.


# Configurations files

The configuration files are XML formatted.  There are two type of configuration
file:
 * Configuration file for the shadow-builder.
 * Configuration file for the TFA core.

## Shadow builder configuration

The configuration file for the shadow builder. The default configuration file
will be explained:

``` xml
<!-- A session is unique. The attributes are name which correspond to the
     session name, the output_root_folder that is the output folder where the session folder
     will be generated, and the os that corresponds to the operating platform the code will be
     benchmarked for. Additionally the following attribute can be provided for
     the session node  cpu_arch="architecture of the cpu" cpu_name="Name of the
     cpu" board_name="name of the board" -->
<session name="test" output_root_folder="/tmp/output/" os="Linux">
<!-- There is only one sources element per session. -->
	<sources>
<!-- prj_src element is unique as well, and provid the folder that countains the
     source to benchmark -->
		<prj_src>/home/amalki/prjs/microROS/soft/apps/pipeline-benchmarking/examples/example_stupid_main/</prj_src>

<!-- include element and exclude elements are listed below. Beware the order in
     which they appear matters. The top of the list element had higher priority
     than the one lower in the list -->

<!-- exclude element means that this will include a set of file. In this case
     c files will be included in the list of  files of interest.
     The type can be set only exclusively to "ext" or "folder"
     ext means extension filtering, folder means folder filtering -->
		<include type="ext">.c</include>

<!-- include element mean that this will be excluding folder path relative to the project.
     The files in the folder "build" will be excluded from the list of file of interest.
     The attribute type can be set only exclusively to "ext" or "folder"
	ext means extension filtering, folder means folder filtering -->
		<exclude type="folder">build</exclude>
	</sources>
	<modules category="User">
		<module>Timer</module>
		<module>User</module>
	</modules>
</session>
```

For more information, the list of XML nodes and wttribute are defined in the
header file src_root/shadow-builder/inc/shadow-builder/XMLConfiguration.h


## TFA core configuration

Like for the shadow builder, an example will be explain to understand how to
configure the XML file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--This file is autogenerated at compile time. Do not modify it unless you know what you are doing-->

<!-- This is the list of plugins folder. Currenlty only the first one will be used-->
<plugins>
	<plugin>path_to_the_plugin/build/tfa-plugins/</plugin>
</plugins>
```
