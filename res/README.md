Configuration Files and Tools
============================


This folder holds three subfolders:
 * _sb-res_  holds shadow-builder configurations files,
 * _tfa-res_ holds TFA confguration files,
 * _tools_ holds tools.


# Configuration files

The configuration files are XML formatted. There are two types of configuration files:
 * shadow-builder configuration file,
 * TFA core configuration file.

## Shadow builder configuration

The default configuration file for the shadow builder is shown below and it can be helpful in understanding the configuration rules. Its details are explained in the comments.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--This file is autogenerated at compile time. Do not modify it unless you know what you are doing-->

<!-- A session is unique. The attributes are name which correspond to the
     session name, the output_root_folder that is the output folder where the session folder
     will be generated, and the os that corresponds to the operating platform the code will be
     benchmarked for. Additionally the following attribute can be provided for
     the session node  cpu_arch="architecture of the cpu" cpu_name="Name of the
     cpu" board_name="name of the board" -->
<session name="test" output_root_folder="/tmp/output/" os="Linux">
<!-- There is only one sources element per session. -->
	<sources>
<!-- prj_src element is unique as well, and provid the folder that countains the
     source to benchmark -->
		<prj_src>src_root/examples/example_stupid_main/</prj_src>

<!-- include element and exclude elements are listed below. Beware the order in
     which they appear matters. The top of the list element had higher priority
     than the one lower in the list -->

<!-- exclude element means that this will include a set of file. In this case
     c files will be included in the list of  files of interest.
     The type can be set only exclusively to "ext" or "folder"
     ext means extension filtering, folder means folder filtering -->
		<include type="ext">.c</include>

<!-- include element mean that this will be excluding folder path relative to the project.
     The files in the folder "build" will be excluded from the list of file of interest.
     The attribute type can be set only exclusively to "ext" or "folder"
	ext means extension filtering, folder means folder filtering -->
		<exclude type="folder">build</exclude>
	</sources>
	<modules category="User">
		<module>Timer</module>
		<module>User</module>
	</modules>
</session>
```

The list of valid XML nodes and attributes can be found in the
header file `src_root/shadow-builder/inc/shadow-builder/XMLConfiguration.h`.


## TFA core configuration

The default configuration file for the TFA core is shown below. Its details are explained in the comments.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--This file is autogenerated at compile time. Do not modify it unless you know what you are doing-->

<!-- This is the list of plugins folder. Currenlty only the first one will be used-->
<plugins>
	<plugin>src_root/build/tfa-plugins/</plugin>
</plugins>
```

# Tools

Tools, which are provided to support developping plugins, are listed below:

 * _plugin_creator.sh_ creates a new plugin project. More details can be found in the readme file [tools/plugin_creator/README.md](tools/plugin_creator/README.md).
