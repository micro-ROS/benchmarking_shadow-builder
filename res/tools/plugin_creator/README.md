# Plugin Creator

From the shadow builder root folder run the command

``` shell 
./res/tools/plugin_creator/create_plugin.sh 
 <PluginName>
```

to generate the `<PluginName>` plugin base project. The script will create the folder `src_root/tfa-plugin/<PluginName>`  as the starting point for its implementation.
